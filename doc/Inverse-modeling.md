A data assimilation module of IGM permits to seek optimal ice thickness, top ice surface, and ice flow parametrization, that best explains observational data while being consistent with the ice flow emulator. This page explain how to use the data assimilation module as a preliminary step in IGM of a forward/prognostic model run.
